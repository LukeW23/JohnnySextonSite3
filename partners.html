Make-A-Wish Ireland has one simple aim – to grant the wishes of children 
with life-threatening medical conditions, to bring hope, strength and happiness. 
        </p><p>
Since 1992, Make-A-Wish has granted wishes for more than 2,900 brave children 
across Ireland, including 183 wishes granted in 2022 alone. A wish granted is 
true magic for the child, providing respite from their normal routines of 
hospitals, doctors and treatment. Make-A-Wish does not receive any government 
funding and relies overwhelmingly on the kindness of the Irish public to continue 
granting wishes. 
        </p><p>
As a well-respected and popular children’s charity, Make-A-Wish is fully committed 
to providing the maximum level of care and enjoyment for our children and their 
families. This is achieved through a combination of professionalism, attention to 
detail and sensitivity. Nothing is too much trouble for a wish child.
        </p><p>
In all possible cases, Make-A-Wish ensures that all immediate family members can 
participate in the child’s wish. In doing so the family can create lasting, happy 
memories.
        </p><p>
Make-A-Wish Ireland is ‘triple locked’ by Charities Institute Ireland for best 
practice in transparency and accountability.
