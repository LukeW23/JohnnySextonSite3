          Jonathan Jeremiah Sexton (born 11 July 1985) is an Irish professional rugby union player 
          who plays as a fly-half for and captains the Ireland national team. He also played club 
          rugby for Leinster and Racing 92.
        </p><p>
          He also represented the British & Irish Lions on their 2013 and 2017 tours, and has scored over 
          1,000 points in his international career, making him one of the highest points-scorers in rugby 
          union history. He has been described by players and coaches as the world's best fly-half and as 
          Ireland's best ever player.
        </p><p>
          Sexton was the winner of World Rugby Player of the Year in 2018, having previously been a 
          nominee for the award in 2014 and then again in 2022. He was the second Irish player in history 
          to win the award, after inaugural winner Keith Wood, in 2001.
        </p><p>
          Sexton became the 106th player to captain Ireland when he led the team out at their 2019 Rugby 
          World Cup 3rd Pool A group match at the Kobe Misaki Stadium in Japan on 3 October 2019. He was 
          officially named captain for the 2020 Six Nations Championship, a role he retained through the 
          2023 tournament.
